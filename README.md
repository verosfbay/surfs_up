# Surfs Up Analysis 

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to obtain clear insights on the weather patterns on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, to determine whether it would be economically viable to start a surf & ice cream shop there. Excessive rain would make it a bad decision, so I'm making sure that the weather is relatively stable year-round to make this project worth the effort. 

### Tools
* VS Code
* Python & Jypyter Notebook
* SQLite
* Flask

## Results
* The average temperature in June is around 75ยบ Farenheit. 
* The average temperature in December is around 71ยบ Farenheit. 
* The minimum temperature in December is 56ยบ Farenheit.

### Summary
The results give us the data we're looking for, that the temperatures on Oahu are relatively stable throughout the year. Even though it can get as low as 56 degrees in December, it can also heat up to 83 degrees, which is the max reported temperature for December. June doesn't get uncomfortably hot, maxing out at 85 degrees, which is great because when it's too hot people don't want to go outside. Looking at this data alone, we have the green light to open up the surf & ice cream shop. 

### Digging deeper
I would run an additional query to find the amount of precipitation in June and December, so I can look at statistics such as max precipitation and the number of rainy days in each month. I would also put this data on a graph to have a visualizer of the rainy season, and see if there is a particular time when the weather is extra rough, like if there's a storm.
